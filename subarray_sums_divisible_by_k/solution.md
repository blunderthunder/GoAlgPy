## Solution to Subarray Sums Divisible by K

```
Time Complexity: O(n + k ) 

Space Complexity: O(K) ( for storing k data in list)
```

## Summary

| Language | Runtime | Memory  |
| :--------| :------ | :------ |
| python3  | 321 ms   | 19 MB |
| go       | 40 ms  | 7.3 MB  |

*With exact same code , Considering both runtime and Memory , i.e.  321/40 and  19/7.3-> 20*

>Go is 20 times efficient than python for this example.
